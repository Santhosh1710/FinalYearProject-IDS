## 🚀 Features

- **Packet Analysis**: Classify network packets as Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, or U2R using multiple ML models.
- **CNN-LSTM Highlight**: Prominently displays predictions from the advanced CNN-LSTM model.
- **Predefined Packets**: Select from sample packets (e.g., Normal HTTP, DoS Smurf) for quick testing.
- **Interactive UI**: Collapsible form sections, theme toggle (light/dark), and animated results.
- **Probability Visualization**: Bar chart showing CNN-LSTM prediction probabilities.
- **Downloadable Results**: Export predictions as a text file.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## 📋 Usage

1. **Select a Predefined Packet**  
   Choose a sample packet (e.g., "DoS Smurf") from the dropdown to auto-fill the form, or manually enter packet details (e.g., Duration, Protocol Type).

2. **Analyze Packet**  
   Click **Analyze Packet** to submit the form and view predictions from CNN-LSTM, consensus, and other models (e.g., AdaBoost, Random Forest).

3. **Explore Results**  
   - CNN-LSTM prediction highlighted with a probability chart  
   - Download results via the **Download Prediction** button

4. **Toggle Theme**  
   Click **Toggle Theme** to switch between light and dark modes. All UI elements adjust accordingly.
