## 🚀 Features

- **Packet Analysis**: Classify network packets as Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, or U2R using multiple ML models.
- **CNN-LSTM Highlight**: Prominently displays predictions from the advanced CNN-LSTM model.
- **Predefined Packets**: Select from sample packets (e.g., Normal HTTP, DoS Smurf) for quick testing.
- **Interactive UI**: Collapsible form sections, theme toggle (light/dark), and animated results.
- **Probability Visualization**: Bar chart showing CNN-LSTM prediction probabilities.
- **Downloadable Results**: Export predictions as a text file.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## 📷 Screenshots

- **Light Theme - Form Input**: Entering packet details in the light theme with clear placeholders.
- **Dark Theme - Form Input**: Same form in dark theme, showcasing adaptive placeholder colors.
- **Prediction Results**: Results displaying CNN-LSTM prediction, consensus, and other models with a probability chart.
- **Mobile View**: Responsive design on a mobile device.

> **Note**: Replace placeholder image paths (e.g., `images/light-theme-form.png`) with actual screenshot files in the `images/` folder.

## 📋 Usage

1. **Select a Predefined Packet**: Choose a sample packet (e.g., "DoS Smurf") from the dropdown to auto-fill the form, or manually enter packet details (e.g., Duration, Protocol Type).
2. **Analyze Packet**: Click **Analyze Packet** to submit the form and view predictions from CNN-LSTM, consensus, and other models (e.g., AdaBoost, Random Forest).
3. **Explore Results**:
   - CNN-LSTM prediction highlighted with a probability chart.
   - Consensus prediction and other model outputs.
   - Download results via the **Download Prediction** button.
4. **Toggle Theme**: Click **Toggle Theme** to switch between light and dark modes. All UI elements adjust accordingly.
