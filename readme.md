## üìã Usage

1. **Select a Predefined Packet**: Choose a sample packet (e.g., "DoS Smurf") from the dropdown to auto-fill the form, or manually enter packet details (e.g., Duration, Protocol Type).
2. **Analyze Packet**: Click **Analyze Packet** to submit the form and view predictions from CNN-LSTM, consensus, and other models (e.g., AdaBoost, Random Forest).
3. **Explore Results**:
   - CNN-LSTM prediction highlighted with a probability chart.
   - Consensus prediction and other model outputs.
   - Download results via the **Download Prediction** button.
4. **Toggle Theme**: Click **Toggle Theme** to switch between light and dark modes. All UI elements adjust accordingly.
